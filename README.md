# Bigdata-Analytics

This project leverages PySpark and its MLlib library to predict the severity of road traffic accidents. By utilizing the powerful distributed processing capabilities of PySpark, the project handles large-scale traffic accident data efficiently. The MLlib library is employed to build and train machine learning models that can effectively predict accident severity based on various features such as weather conditions, vehicle types, and driver information. This approach aims to enhance traffic safety by providing actionable insights and predictions.
